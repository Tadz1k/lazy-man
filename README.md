remote shutdown of the computer via the html server

First contact with Django.
You can connect with HTTP server via mobile, push the panic button and turn off the computer remotely.

Run that **** with python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 (for example) and now you do not have to get up from bed when you are going to sleep after Netflix session.
Enjoy, thanks
